## Available Plugins

| Plugin | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [chezmoi](plugins/chezmoi/) | Chezmoi-aware dotfile editing guard and expertise. Prevents direct edits to chezmoi-managed files and provides chezmoi workflow guidance. |
| [gh-stack](plugins/gh-stack/) | Drive GitHub's native stacked pull requests (the `github/gh-stack` extension) as a non-interactive agent. JSON state reporting, worktree-private state detection, and gated submit. |
| [pr-stack](plugins/pr-stack/) | Plan and implement features as stacks of small, focused PRs using TDD with git-town branch management. |
| [iterm-notifs](plugins/iterm-notifs/) | iTerm2-native Claude Code notifications: custom OSC 9 banners with project name, dock attention, and per-session waiting state via OSC 1337 user variables. Pairs with an AutoLaunch Python script for sound, voice, and hotkey cycling. |

## Adding a Plugin

Each plugin lives in `plugins/<plugin-name>/` with the standard Claude Code plugin structure:

```
plugins/<plugin-name>/
  .claude-plugin/
    plugin.json
  commands/      # Slash commands (.md)
  agents/        # Subagent definitions (.md)
  skills/        # Skills (subdirs with SKILL.md)
  hooks/         # Event handlers (hooks.json)
```

Register it in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` under the `plugins` array.
